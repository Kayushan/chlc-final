  # Strip Down Security for Small School Environment

  1. Security Changes
    - Disable RLS on both attendance_logs and schedules tables
    - Remove all foreign key constraints
    - Drop all existing policies

  2. Rationale
    - Small school environment with trusted users
    - Prioritize functionality over strict security
    - Eliminate all 403/406/409 errors
    - Enable rapid development and testing
